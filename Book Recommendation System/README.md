# Book Recommendation System

This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms in Python. The system preprocesses data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), evaluates models, and deploys the system as a web app with Flask.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering for user-based and item-based recommendations
- Content-based filtering using book attributes
- Data preprocessing for cleaning and transforming raw book data
- EDA for gaining insights into user preferences and book features
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Deployment as a web app with Flask

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and preprocessed data files
- `models/`: Contains the implementation of collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions for data preprocessing and EDA
- `app.py`: Flask web app for the recommendation system
